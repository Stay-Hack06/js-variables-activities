# Variables in JavaScript

### Background

##### Declaring A Variable

- Declaring a variable in JavaScript is the process of creating a container to store data. Variables allow you to hold values of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. They provide a way to store data temporarily in memory so that you can use and manipulate it later in your code.

- To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the let or const keyword (var is also a keyword that can be used, sparingly) followed by the variable name. The syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

```javascript
let userAge;
const daysOfTheWeek;
```

##### Assigning A Variable

- Assigning a variable in JavaScript means giving it a value. Once you declare a variable, you can assign a specific value to it or update its value at any time during the execution of your code.

- To assign a value to a variable in JavaScript, you use the assignment operator (`=`). The syntax for assigning a variable is as follows:

```javascript
let userAge = 43;
let userName = "Colin";
const PI = 3.14159;
```

- Assigning values to variables:

```javascript
userAge = 25;
userName = "Marc Antony";
```

- Variables can be assigned different values later:

```javascript
let name = "Colin";
let age = 29;

age = 30;
name = "Cleopatra";
```

- Constants are assigned a value when declared—they can't be reassigned new values, so the only way they get a value is when they're declared.

```javascript
const daysInWeek = 7;
```

### Activities

##### Prep

1. Connect your js file to your HTML file
2. Open your code in the browser (directly or via Live Server) and open your console

##### Exercise 1

1. Look at the figma_design file in the assets folder of this repo.
2. List all of the possible variables that exist on the page, and declare them as variables.

##### Exercise 2

Declaring variables is an important way to work with data in your JavaScript file.

Follow the instructions in the `scripts.js` file for Declaring Variables.

##### Exercise 3

You will need to be able to reassign the values of a variable. This can be helpful when working with different datasets.

1. Take the strings listed and make sure that they are formatted property.
2. Follow the instructions in th `scripts.js` file for Reassigning Variables.

##### Exercise 4

This exercise will have you working with `const`.

Follow the instructions in th `scripts.js` file for Working With Constants.

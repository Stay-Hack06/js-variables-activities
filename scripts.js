/************************ Exercise 1 - Identify Variables ************************/

// Declare Variables Here


let totalSales;
let totalExpense;
let totalProfit;
let adSpent;
let upsell;
let employes;
let bundels;
let apps;
let abandanctCart;
let status;
let spent;
let Return;
let costConversion
let costClick
let CTR;
let ageGroup
let location




/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 
let firstName = 'Staysha';
let lastName = 'Hackmann';
let age = '33';


// Log the variables' values to the console.

console.log(firstName+' '+lastName+' '+age);



/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignmentâ€”don't change the previous lines of code!

// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.

let a = "apple";
let b = "banana";
let c = "candy";
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);





/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/

// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 

// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 

// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.

const PI = 3.14159;
PI = 25

// Assignment to constant variable. 
//Because const assigns a constant variable. It becomes 'permanent' and can't be changed like other variables.
